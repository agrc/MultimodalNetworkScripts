# Multimodal Network Scripts
This repo contains scripts that build the Multimodal Network Dataset that can be found on the UGRC [Street Network Analysis data page](https://gis.utah.gov/data/transportation/street-network-analysis/#MultimodalNetwork).

When creating this network dataset, the scripts must be run asynchronously in this order:
1. create_network_data.py
2. create_connectors.py
3. create_network.py
